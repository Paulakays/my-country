    <h3>Counties and regions of Kenya</h3>
    <p>
        Kenya is divided into 47 counties, each governed by a county government under the devolved system of governance.
        The counties are based on the former districts of Kenya and were established under the 2010 constituition to
        decentralize political and administrative functions. Each county is headed by a governor and has its own county
        assembly, which legislates on its jurisdiction. This system was designed to bring government services closer to
        the people and promote local development.
        Kenya is traditionally divided into several regions, though these regions do not have administrative functions
        under the current system of counties. The table below represents the counties and their respective regions.
